Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. Eliptical talk. A major key, never panic. Don’t panic, when it gets crazy and rough, don’t panic, stay calm. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. We the best. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple.

You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Congratulations, you played yourself. Surround yourself with angels. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. Don’t ever play yourself. Surround yourself with angels. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. 

To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. Fan luv. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. Eliptical talk. Stay focused.
